User Authentication System Requirements

The system shall provide a secure user authentication mechanism. When a user attempts to access the system, the authentication module validates the user credentials against the database. The user must enter a valid username and password to proceed with authentication.

If the authentication fails, the system displays an error message to the user. After three failed authentication attempts, the system temporarily locks the user account for security purposes. The administrator can unlock the user account through the admin panel.

Password Management

The system allows users to change their password at any time. When a user requests a password change, the system validates the current password before accepting the new password. The new password must meet the security requirements defined by the administrator.

The system provides a password reset functionality for users who forget their password. The user enters their email address, and the system sends a password reset link to that email address. The password reset link remains valid for 24 hours.

User Profile Management

Each user has a profile containing personal information. The user can view and modify their profile data at any time. The profile includes the username, email address, phone number, and profile picture.

When a user modifies their profile, the system validates the modified data before saving. The system ensures that the email address is unique across all user profiles. If validation succeeds, the system saves the profile changes to the database.

Role-Based Access Control

The system implements role-based access control to manage user permissions. Each user is assigned one or more roles. Each role defines a set of permissions that determine what actions the user can perform.

The administrator creates and manages roles through the admin panel. When creating a role, the administrator specifies the role name and assigns permissions to that role. The system validates that the role name is unique.

The system checks user permissions before allowing access to protected resources. If the user lacks the required permissions, the system denies access and displays an appropriate error message.

Session Management

When a user successfully completes authentication, the system creates a new session for that user. The session stores user information and maintains the authentication state. Each session has a unique session identifier.

The system automatically expires inactive sessions after 30 minutes. The user can manually terminate their session by logging out. When the session expires or the user logs out, the system destroys the session data.

Data Synchronization

The system periodically synchronizes user data with the remote server. The synchronization process compares local data with remote data to identify changes. If the system detects conflicts during synchronization, it applies conflict resolution rules.

The administrator configures the synchronization schedule through the admin panel. The system logs all synchronization activities for audit purposes. Users can view the synchronization status in their profile settings.

Audit and Logging

The system maintains comprehensive audit logs for security and compliance. The system logs all authentication attempts, both successful and failed. The system also logs all permission checks and access denials.

The administrator can view and filter audit logs through the admin panel. The audit logs include timestamps, user identifiers, and action descriptions. The system retains audit logs for a configurable retention period.

Notification System

The system sends notifications to users for important events. When the system detects a failed authentication attempt, it sends a security notification to the user email address. The system also sends notifications for password changes and profile modifications.

Users can configure their notification preferences in their profile settings. The administrator can disable or enable specific notification types through the admin panel.

Administrator Functions

The administrator has full control over system configuration and user management. The administrator can create, modify, and delete user accounts. The administrator assigns roles to users and manages role permissions.

The system provides the administrator with dashboard displaying system statistics. The dashboard shows the number of active users, recent authentication attempts, and system health metrics. The administrator can export system data for reporting purposes.

Database Management

The system stores all data in a relational database. The database contains tables for users, roles, permissions, sessions, and audit logs. The system validates all data before inserting into the database.

The system performs regular database backups to prevent data loss. The administrator configures the backup schedule and retention policy. The system encrypts sensitive data before storing in the database.

Security Requirements

The system implements multiple security measures to protect user data. All passwords are hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms before storage. The system uses secure communication protocols for all data transmission.

The system implements protection against common security vulnerabilities. The system validates all user input to prevent injection attacks. The system implements rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks.

The administrator regularly reviews security logs and updates security policies. The system notifies the administrator of any suspicious activities or potential security breaches.
